# Ex3 -Tweets Generator

## Overview
This project generates tweets using a Markov Chain algorithm. It processes an existing dataset of tweets and creates new ones based on the probabilities of word sequences.

## How it Works
1. **Input**: Reads a file containing a corpus of tweets.
2. **Learning**: Builds a Markov Chain by analyzing the dataset to understand word transitions and their frequencies.
3. **Output**: Generates new tweets by selecting words probabilistically based on the learned word sequences.
